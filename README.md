- **Decision Factors:** Purchase price, operating costs, environmental impact, and long-term value

### Audience Interest in Visualization

**Why This Data Matters to Our Audience:**

1. **Financial Impact**
   - Understanding how TV technology and size choices directly affect monthly electricity bills
   - Calculating long-term cost implications over typical TV lifespan (7-10 years)
   - Identifying the most cost-effective options that balance performance with efficiency

2. **Environmental Consciousness**
   - Growing awareness of personal carbon footprint and energy consumption
   - Desire to make environmentally responsible purchasing decisions
   - Understanding how individual choices contribute to broader sustainability goals

3. **Technology Understanding**
   - Need for clear, accessible explanations of technical differences (LED vs OLED vs QLED)
   - Translation of complex technical specifications into practical benefits and trade-offs
   - Guidance on which technologies offer the best efficiency without sacrificing quality

4. **Decision Confidence**
   - Overwhelmed by marketing claims and technical jargon from manufacturers
   - Seeking objective, data-driven insights to cut through advertising noise
   - Want evidence-based recommendations tailored to different priorities and budgets

**How Our Visualizations Serve Their Interests:**
- **Clear Context:** Each chart explains why the data matters for daily life and purchasing decisions
- **Practical Translation:** Technical data converted into understandable cost and environmental implications
- **Actionable Insights:** Specific guidance for different consumer priorities (efficiency, budget, performance)
- **Progressive Understanding:** Story builds from basic concepts to informed decision-making capability

## About the Data

### Data Source
The television energy consumption analysis utilizes data from:
- **Australian Government Energy Rating Database:** Official energy efficiency ratings and power consumption specifications for televisions sold in Australia
- **Equipment Energy Efficiency (E3) Program:** Comprehensive database maintained by the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water
- **Manufacturer Specifications:** Technical documentation from major TV brands available in the Australian market
- **Time Period:** Current market data representing models available in 2024-2025

### Data Processing
**Collection Methodology:**
- Data extracted from official government energy rating databases and verified manufacturer specifications
- Focus on key analytical dimensions: screen technology type, display size, power consumption, energy star ratings, and brand information
- Standardization of measurement units and categorization systems for consistent cross-brand analysis

**Processing Steps:**
1. **Data Extraction:** Systematic collection from official sources and manufacturer documentation
2. **Cleaning and Validation:** Removal of duplicate entries, standardization of units, and verification against multiple sources
3. **Categorization:** Classification of screen technologies and size ranges for analytical comparison
4. **Quality Assurance:** Cross-referencing official energy ratings with manufacturer specifications for accuracy

### Privacy
- **No Personal Information:** Analysis exclusively uses publicly available product specifications and official energy ratings
- **Aggregated Analysis:** All findings presented at product category and brand level with no individual consumer data involved
- **Public Data Sources:** All information derived from publicly accessible government databases and manufacturer specifications
- **Anonymized Insights:** Focus on product performance characteristics rather than individual purchasing behavior

### Accuracy and Limitations

**Accuracy Measures:**
- Data sourced exclusively from official government energy rating programs and verified manufacturer specifications
- Cross-validation between multiple authoritative sources to ensure consistency
- Analysis limited to current models available in the Australian retail market

**Known Limitations:**
1. **Temporal Constraints:** TV market evolves rapidly; analysis represents a specific time period and may not reflect future model availability
2. **Usage Variability:** Actual power consumption varies significantly based on user settings, content type, and viewing habits
3. **Market Dynamics:** Product availability, pricing, and specifications change frequently in the consumer electronics market
4. **Scope Boundaries:** Analysis focuses specifically on energy efficiency and may not account for other important factors like picture quality, features, or reliability

**Data Disclaimer:** This analysis provides general trends and comparative insights. Individual purchasing decisions should consider current market conditions, personal usage patterns, and updated energy ratings at time of purchase.

### Ethics

**Ethical Framework:**
- **Consumer Benefit Focus:** Analysis designed to serve consumer interests rather than commercial promotion
- **Transparency and Disclosure:** All data sources, methodologies, and limitations clearly identified and communicated
- **Environmental Responsibility:** Emphasis on promoting energy efficiency aligns with sustainability and environmental protection goals
- **Objective Analysis:** Findings presented without bias toward specific brands, technologies, or commercial interests

**Responsible Data Use:**
- Equal treatment of all brands and technologies in comparative analysis
- Clear distinction between factual findings and interpretive recommendations
- Acknowledgment of limitations and uncertainties in data and analysis
- Promotion of informed decision-making rather than directive purchasing guidance
